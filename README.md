Landing page for Hook Razor product website.

Looking to convert site visitors to buy the Hook Razor.

It is intended to be a single page site for information on the product with a link to the purchasing site hosted on PhaseFilter.com. TODO: build page for purchasing using Stripe on the site.

Utilizing BootStrap for styles. Need to implement more JS with server for Stripe integration.

Initial try with Stripe was daunting but not feel more comfortable with attempting with my course work.

Would be great to add videos as backgrounds with overlying text.
